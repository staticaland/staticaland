Clean code ≈

Computer things I care about:

- [Bits](https://notes.garden/%F0%9F%8C%B2+Notes/Bits) because it's everything.
- [Site Reliability Engineering](https://notes.garden/Cards/%F0%9F%8C%B2+Notes/Site+Reliability+Engineering) and the [DevOps](https://notes.garden/Cards/%F0%9F%8C%B2+Notes/DevOps) paradigm.
- [Go](https://notes.garden/%F0%9F%8C%B2+Notes/Golang) because it's simple and beautiful.
- [Python](https://notes.garden/%F0%9F%8C%B2+Notes/Python) because it's so fun and vibrant.
- [Terraform](https://notes.garden/Cards/%F0%9F%8C%B2+Notes/Terraform) because it's so effective.
- [Emacs](https://notes.garden/%F0%9F%8C%B2+Notes/Emacs) with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) because it's the best tool to handle complexity.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) because a good structure for knowledge enables flow and higher states of creative thinking. It's a neuroprosthetic.
- Spaced repitition with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to make memory a choice.[^1][^2][^3]
